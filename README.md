# Predicting-Distributed-Denial-of-Service-Attacks

## Overview
This repository contains a project aimed at predicting and classifying Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using machine learning techniques. The project analyzes network traffic patterns to detect anomalies indicative of potential attacks, providing a foundation for proactive cybersecurity measures.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares network traffic data for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts key features from network traffic to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Model Development**: Implements and compares multiple machine learning models for DDoS attack detection.
- **Classification Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Repository Contents
- `ddos-attack-detection-classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and usage instructions.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:
Handles missing values, normalizes features, and encodes categorical data.
Feature Selection:
Identifies key indicators of DDoS attacks, such as traffic volume and packet patterns.
Model Training:
Implements machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Evaluation:
Uses confusion matrices and ROC curves to assess model performance.
Results
High accuracy achieved in detecting DDoS attacks.
Model highlights key traffic patterns that differentiate normal activity from malicious attacks.
Future Work
Expand dataset to include a wider range of network traffic scenarios.
Implement deep learning models for improved detection accuracy.
Integrate real-time monitoring for live attack prediction.
